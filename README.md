Identity & Access Management (IAM) Architect • Cloud Security • Automation Engineering  
</h3>

---

I'm an IT and security professional based in Singapore with over a decade of experience across multiple global industries.  
My work focuses on **Identity & Access Management**, **Zero Trust security**, and **automation for security and infrastructure platforms**.

I design and implement identity architectures across cloud environments (AWS, Azure), SaaS platforms, and enterprise systems, with hands-on experience building secure access workflows, identity governance automation, and cloud-native security controls.

My GitHub mainly contains tooling, experiments, and automation scripts I build in my personal time to stay sharp and explore new ideas. I keep most work private due to the nature of my roles, but I occasionally publish safe, simplified versions of utilities and prototypes.

### 🔭 What I'm focused on
- Identity & Access Management Architecture  
- Zero Trust / Identity-first Security  
- Privileged Access & Secrets Management  
- Automation for cloud and identity platforms  

### 🌱 What I'm learning
- Advanced AWS cloud security  
- Python for automation and tooling  
- Identity governance frameworks
